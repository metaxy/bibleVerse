Installation
============

First, you need a complete build environment. You must install packages cmake, make, gcc, g++, gettext and
KDE development packages. These packages are called differently, depending on your distribution:
kde-devel on Ubuntu, task-kde4-devel on Mandriva, or similar.

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` 
make
make install
kbuildsycoca4

It was tested with KDE 4.3.1 and Qt 4.5.1

If you upgraded from a previous version, don't forget to restart plasma:
Run the following command from the console: "kquitapp plasma-desktop && sleep 3 && plasma-desktop && exit"
Please note: You might have to re-install bibleVerse after KDE or Qt upggrades, otherwise you might experience plasma crashes.
